        /*
        JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
--------------------Block scope -----------------------
let and const : Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.


--------------------Function scope----------------------
Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.


--------------------Global scope------------------------
Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.
Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
